                            <br>
                            Eren Yeager was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina 
                            District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. 
                            This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all
                            costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 
                            5th best, and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of 
                            Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans. After eating the younger sister of 
                            Willy Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.

                            The Power of the Titans allows Subjects of Ymir to become Titans with their own will and unique abilities
                             and traits. These titans acquire memories from the past inheritors of the power. If a pure titan devours a holder 
                             of the Power of the Titans, the abilities and memories will be transferred to the pure Titan, and will 
                             return the pure Titan's human form. This power will only stay with them for 13 years, as is the duration of the Curse 
                             of Ymir.

                            The Attack Titan can also see the memories of its future owners up to a certain
                            degree. The Attack Titan also decides the extent of memory sharing. It could be seen when Eren Kruger mentions Armin and Mikasa, but he 
                            did not really recognize them.
                            <br>
