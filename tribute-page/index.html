                        Eren Yeager was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina 
                        District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. 
                        This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all
                         costs and retake Wall Maria. He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.

                        In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 
                        5th best, and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of 
                        Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.

                        <br>
                        Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans. After eating the younger sister of 
                        Willy Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.

                            The Power of the Titans allowed Subjects of Ymir to transform into intelligent Titans with specific characteristics 
                            and unique abilities, known as the Nine Titans. The holders of the Nine Titans were able to regenerate from injuries, 
                            and gained access to the memories of previous Subjects of Ymir that held the power before them. If a Pure Titan 
                            gained the power of the Titans, that Titan would return to being a human.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The first Titan, Ymir Fritz, was killed thirteen years after acquiring the power of the Titans.
                            Because it is impossible for anyone to surpass the Founder, each person who gains the power of the Titans is 
                            faced with the "Curse of Ymir‚Äù, which limits their remaining lifespan to only 13 years after first acquiring it. 
                            During the last years of their life, their body will weaken until they perish.

                                the two were born, although he admitted that he did not recognize where those two names came from. Grisha would have some 
                                insight on the Fall of Wall Maria hours before its occurrence through Eren's memories. Eren had glimpsed future events
